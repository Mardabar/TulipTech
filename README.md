Started working on [Automatic Tunning](https://pedropathing.com/docs/pathing/tuning/automatic). 

- Maximum forward velocity, and forward deaccleration are set and look right.
- All the wood we have on a robot prevents it from strafing without shifting sideways. It looks like the wood bounces and skews the direction.
